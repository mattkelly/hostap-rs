hostap is a Linux tool for debugging 802.11 wireless devices.
It provides an out of the box solution for eavesdropping on Wi-Fi devices for
testing purposes. This is achieved by setting up a local wireless network on an
interface that supports AP mode then routing traffic to the external network.

## Warning
This tool currently requires root access for the following:
- Allow NetworkManager to ignore the selected interface
- Bring up/down the selected wireless interface using iproute2
- Use sysctl to forward ipv4 packets
- Manipulate the host's internal routing table to forward ip packets

## Dependencies
- NetworkMananger (only supported manager currently)
- iproute2
- hostapd
- dhcpd
- iptables

## Tested Network Adapters
To use this tool, you must have a dongle or local wireless interface that supports AP mode.

Supported adaptors:
- Alfa AWUS036NHA

## Quick Start
1. Select your wireless interface from the following list:
```sh
ip link
```
2. Bring up a network on the selected interface:
```sh
hostap -i <interface>
```
